## Assigning version numbers

This is an aside, and I'm not really going to apply it here
to ThunderBolt,  but more for the first products of TB.

There are lots of opinions on this, but here's my take:

### 0.0.xx  Concept Docs
In the 0.0 range development should be design articles describing the product 
as envisioned at the outset.  Docs will revise and update throughout the cycle, of course,
but the idea here is to capture all the preliminary foundational notions in a checklist
sort of fashion.

Even though we use only the revision number here, 
we can have multiple revs per section by appending other numbers.
for example 0.0.10, 0.0.11, etc.
or even 0.0.19, 0.0.110...

###### 0.0.1x Raw concept
White paper describing the product
###### 0.0.2x Technology approach 1
Key technology pieces explained and the engineering approach that will be used
###### 0.0.3x Technology approach 2
More Tech Approach musings, if necessary.
###### 0.0.4x Audience Marketing and Monetization 1
Who is the audience and what is the monetization strategy? Marketing ideas?
###### 0.0.5x Audience Marketing and Monetization 2
More on monetization, particularly if there are nuances like in-app purposes
or subscription variants or multi-tiered offferings.
###### 0.0.6x Storyboard design 
Walk through of the app flow and the basic UX, plus 
a more thorough storyboard treatment, with UX interaction details and interaction diagrams where appropriate.  UML where appropriate.
###### 0.0.7x Stylistic design
A Style Guide, and concept mocks for all major page views.
###### 0.0.8x Implementation milestone schedule plan
A milestone breakdown for each development release as shown below, and target dates for each.
This schedule will be updated to match development / Agile realities.
###### 0.0.9x Completed Design Plan
All components complete as a ready-to-implement design.


### 0.x.x  App Development
Design plan in place, we start the process of implementation, using
the following release numbering scheme:


##### 0.1.x Basic shell / rough storyboard
Just enough to get things up and running
##### 0.2.x Technology proofs and tests
Make sure the envisioned core tech works as anticipated
and adjust designs to match any differences from original expectation.
##### 0.3.x Storyboard flow / basic UX
User navigates through app as they will with few if any placeholders.
##### 0.4.x Styling applied
CSS and graphic styling from design is applied to form the
first realized look.  Style can update and revise from here on, too, of course.
##### 0.5.x First Friends and Family Previoew version (Alpha)
Internal review and comment version for friendly audience input.
##### 0.6.x Review Feature Requests and Bug Fixes
Fixes most important bugs and/or most requested feature 
addition/change 
##### 0.7.x Review Feature Requests and Bug Fixes
Next most requested feature addition/change 
##### 0.8.x Review Feature Requests and Bug Fixes 
Last of the major bug fixes / requested feature addition/changes
##### 0.9.x Extended Preview / (Beta and RC)
Version for review by less friendly audiences,
outside of internal F&F group.
##### 1.0.0 Release to public
Upversion out of the zeroes only after all i's are dotted and t's are crossed,
and there has been sufficient critical review to insure
there will be no surprises in the wild on release.
App Store submission information is ready.
